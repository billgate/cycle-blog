Cycle blog
==================

This is a blog application for my own purposes of driving personal blog.

## Very useful commands

`npm run dev-server` Runs development server with client side HMR and restarts when you change any file in _src/server_

`npm run watch-test-server` Runs server tests and runs these tests again on any file change in _src/server_
